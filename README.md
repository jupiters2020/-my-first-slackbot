Congratulations, you have successfully downloaded my-first-slackbot file! 

Attempt at Story Telling/ Joke Telling Bot using Poems, Quotes, Story Beginnings and Chuck Norris Jokes!

BOT: hubot-7

Difficulties: 

Tried to use axios for slackbot APIs to wire in Chuck Norris Jokes using http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/ and Quotes from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BolajiAyodeji/inspireNuggets/master/src/quotes.json. Don't know if there's significant roadblocks in these apart from using terminal to execute the axios code. Not quite sure how JSON requirements also work yet, but have made an attempt. 

Task Notes:
// 1. A Message Post to Slack based on User Input
// 2. Do at least 3 different things
// 3. Utilise the list of people in the class to send a direct message - A bit difficult for everyone but have tried for 'Drew'
// 4. Leverage Hubot
// 5. At least 1 conditional to change the Hubot 
// 6. Leverage a for loop
// 7. Introduce a random component -
// 8. readme

//These are from the scripting documentation: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md
