"poetry" in the-official-hubot-testing-org-for-ga-jsr-121

"I met a traveller from an antique land, Who saidâ€” Two vast and trunkless legs of stone. Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand, Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, Tell that its sculptor well those passions read, Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed. And on the pedestal, these words appear." Ozymandias

if (Drew) "Someone does not like poetry"

Approaches Taken: 

Worked hard on trying to simplify the code and tried different variants, attempting to use some previous js from past lessons as new ways to script. Attempted to cover all of the questions, particularly the random generators and axios APIs, as they allowed for live-ness that I thought was interactive and approachable. I review existing Slackbots and Hubots, trying to identify the basics.
Begin by writing down what your different commands (perhaps still haven't quite fleshed some of them out to their full potential.

Don't think I quite inputted the commands for .hear, .listen to access them easily enough for the API commands. It was challenging and enjoyable, will continue to develop HUBOT-7 over the Christmas break and continue to grow and develop the code. Specified challenges and difficulties to work on below.  

Difficulties/ Challenges: 

Tried to use axios for slackbot APIs to wire in Chuck Norris Jokes using http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/ and Quotes from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BolajiAyodeji/inspireNuggets/master/src/quotes.json. Don't know if there's significant roadblocks in these apart from using terminal to execute the axios code. Not quite sure how JSON requirements also work yet, but have made an attempt. 

explanations of what your bot does, what commands it responds to, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

Task Notes:
// 1. A Message Post to Slack based on User Input
// 2. Do at least 3 different things
// 3. Utilise the list of people in the class to send a direct message - A bit difficult for everyone but have tried for 'Drew'
// 4. Leverage Hubot
// 5. At least 1 conditional to change the Hubot 
// 6. Leverage a for loop
// 7. Introduce a random component -
// 8. readme
